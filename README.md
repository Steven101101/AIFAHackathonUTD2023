## Senior Support
## Inspiration:
 What inspired us to create Senior Support was seeing our grandparents struggling with everyday tasks. Our grandparents have us to help them, however many other senior citizens live alone and have little to no assistance. So, we wanted to create an app to help elderly citizens like them that need extra help.

## What it does:
 When you open the app, it will take you to the homepage where there will be 2 options. Help or request help. You will have to fill out some information such as your name, location, and assistance needs if you choose the request help option. There will also be a button called “suggestions for activities” where AI is implemented to give you activity recommendations. After submitting the form, you will be redirected to a thank you page and after 5 seconds on that page it will redirect you to the home page. Now if you click the help button you will be directed to a senior selection page where you choose a senior to help. After clicking accept on a senior it will redirect you to a thank you page where after 5 seconds it will take you back to the home page.

## How we built it:
 First, we brainstormed app ideas for social good. After we came up with our idea we started to imagine and plan out what we wanted it to look like. Next, we thought about functionality, purpose and accessibility. While someone worked on the back end, another person worked on the front end and created the logo. During that time we also filmed our video presentation and filled out our written document.

## Challenges we ran into:
 Some challenges we faced while developing the app were implementing AI, and figuring out how we wanted our frontend to appear.
Accomplishments that we're proud of: We have accomplished making our app both accessible and easy for people to use.

## What we learned:
 During this process we learned how to work effectively as a team. Additionally, we expanded our knowledge and gained new insights into AI.
What's next for Senior Support: In the future, our goal is to continuously improve our AI functionality and capabilities within this program.
